# 🧠 Cluster Headache Tracker Android

Cluster Headache Tracker Android is a Hotwire Native wrapper for the [Cluster Headache Tracker](https://github.com/crmne/cluster-headache-tracker) web application. This app uses [Hotwire Native for Android](https://github.com/hotwired/hotwire-native-android) to provide the web app experience within a native Android app shell.

## 🎯 Purpose

The main reason for creating this Android app is to increase accessibility and visibility of the Cluster Headache Tracker. While the web application functions as a Progressive Web App (PWA), many users are unfamiliar with PWAs or how to add them to their home screens. This native Android wrapper provides a familiar way for users to download and access the app through the App Store.

## 🚀 Features

- 📊 View and interact with headache logs and charts
- 🔒 Secure authentication and data storage (handled by the web app)
